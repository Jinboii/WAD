# IS216 G7T6 - Rebirth
Rebirth is an IS216 Project (AY23/24 Term 1) under Professor MOK Heng Ngee.

# Application background
Rebirth hopes to solve the issue of finding various places to donate different items. The website serves as a platform to connect individuals interested in donating items to places that take it instead of simply throwing it away.

# Setting up the application
Download the source code and save in onto your desktop. All paths in the code are relative, hence the location of the code will not affect the performance of the application. 

# Populating of Databases
1. Open the model/ConnectionManager.php file and ensure that the username and password corresponds to the username and password of your sql client. The default setting would be "root" for the username and "" for the password, which is usually the default for windows users. 

2. Open the create.sql file using your sql client and run the file to populate the database.

# Running the application
Use localhost to access the local code.
