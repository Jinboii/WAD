# IS216 G7T6 - Rebirth
Rebirth is an IS216 Project (AY23/24 Term 1) under Professor MOK Heng Ngee.

# Application background
Rebirth hopes to solve the issue of finding various places to donate/ sell different items. The website will serve as a platform to connect individuals interested in donating items to places that take it instead of simply throwing it away.

# Setting up the application
Download the source code and save in onto your desktop. All paths in the code are relative, hence the location of the code will not affect the performance of the application. Do run create.sql first to set up the databases.

# Running the application
Use localhost to access the local code.
